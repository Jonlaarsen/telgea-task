BetterButton.tsx is in my components folder :)

Task 3. Written response

If I notice inconsistencies in the design, I would first document the issues and bring them to the designer's attention. I would suggest adjustments to ensure a quality product. We would work together to make necessary design changes and ensure that the layout scales well on different devices. Once the design is aligned, I would implement the updates in the code, ensuring that it is both visually consistent and responsive. Testing across various screen sizes would follow to ensure everything looks as intended.
